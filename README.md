# 🧠 Natural Language Processing Projects with Python

Welcome to the **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project repository! This repository showcases a collection of Python programs that demonstrate core concepts, techniques, and models used in the field of NLP. These programs are designed to help you understand how machines can process, analyze, and derive meaning from human language using computational techniques.

## 🌐 What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP is used in many real-world applications such as:

- Sentiment analysis (e.g., analyzing reviews, social media)
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)
- Search engines
- Spelling and grammar correction
- Text classification (e.g., spam detection)

## 🚀 Project Highlights

This repository includes scripts that implement key components of NLP, including:

### 🧹 1. Text Preprocessing
- Tokenization, filtration, and script validation
- Stop word removal and stemming
- Prepares raw text for analysis by cleaning and simplifying it

### 📊 2. N-Gram Language Models
- Build and evaluate Unigram, Bigram, and Trigram models
- Calculate sentence probabilities
- Useful in text prediction and generation

### ✏️ 3. Minimum Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)
- Measure similarity between two strings
- Applications: spell checking, autocorrect, DNA sequencing

### 🌲 4. Parsing with CFG
- Implement Top-Down (Recursive Descent) and Bottom-Up (Shift-Reduce) parsers
- Understand syntax trees and grammar validation

### 📁 5. Naive Bayes Text Classification
- Build a classifier using Add-1 (Laplace) smoothing
- Classify text documents into categories (e.g., action vs. comedy)

### 🔍 6. Information Retrieval
- Explore corpora like Brown, Reuters, Inaugural, and UDHR
- Build conditional frequency distributions
- Segment continuous text using statistical methods

### 🌐 7. Lexical Semantics with WordNet
- Find synonyms and antonyms using NLTK’s WordNet interface
- Useful in semantic search, word sense disambiguation

### 🤖 8. Basic Machine Translation Logic
- Understand encoder-decoder architecture for translation
- Handle low-resource translation scenarios
